        "## Introduction to the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "We describe a solution, in the JavaScrpt running in the Node environment, to the Day 1 problem of the 2022 edition of the highly-popular Advent of Code challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is described in full [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1).  (The reader may need to create an account in order to view it.)  A band og eleves is on a quest to provide energy to santa's reindeer.  Their quest begins with a hike through a jungle area. Below is an excerpt from the Advent of Code sight, describing the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "<blockquote>\n",
        "The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:\n",
        "\n",
        "<hr>\n",
        "```\n",
        "1000\n",
        "2000\n",
        "3000\n",
        "\n",

        "This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.\n",
        "* The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.\n",
        "* The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.\n",

        "* The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.\n",
        "\n",
        "In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).\n",

        "We will be importing data from a source outside the Node envionment, so we'll be working with file-systems.  Accordingly, we import the `fs` and `path` modules:\n",

        "\n",
        "We now use the functionality of the `path` module to construct a string that gives the pathname of the `input.txt` file.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```{ojs}\n",
        "let targetFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \"input.txt\");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above code, `__dirname` evaluates to the full name of the directory containing the file being run, and `path.resolve` puts it together with the second argument\n",
        "to get the full pathnamename of the input file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reading in the Input File\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we use the `fs` module tp read in the file, and the we and convert it to a string:\n",
        "\n",

        "```{ojs}\n",
        "const input = fs.readFileSync(targetFile).toString();\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Processing the Input File\n",
        "\n",
        "We wish to convert the string into an array of values, where each element of the array is the calorie-value of an item.\n",
        "\n",
        "To this end, we must split the string along the newlines within it.  To this end we define a splitting function:\n",

        "\n",
        "Note the use of the Javacript regular expression `/\\n/`).  (In Javascript regular expressions to not start life as strings, as they do in R.  Instead they are a special type of object, delimited by the forward-slash: `/`.
