## Introduction

Below is an interactive plot embedded from [an Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@homerhanumat/stock-price-graphs):

```

Developing in Observable notebooks is usually easier than in Quarto, so embeds are good to keep in mind! (But it seems they sometimes take a while to load.)

## How I Did It

I simply went to the notebook, clicked on the settings for any named cell, and chose which named cells I wanted to embed.  I then copied the embed code into this page, as follows:

````
```{=html}

```
